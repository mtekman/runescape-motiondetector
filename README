Script to automate runescape levelling using xte framework


Auto-Clickers:

	updater_rs.sh --> 
		clicks at random points around centre of window at random intervals

	motion_detect.sh --> 
		screenshots two frames at 1/2 intervals, feeds them into a 
		motion detector, clicks at resultant position


Motion-Detectors:

	dilate_XY.py -->
		Python stab at openCV, differences two images, erodes, dilates,
		returns position of first white pixel. Slow.
	
	skeletonDetect -->
		C++ stab at openCV, background subtracts two images, erodes, dilates,
		returns centre position of largest white blob. Fast. Preferred method.
